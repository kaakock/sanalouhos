# Sanalouhos solver #

Sanaluouhos is a puzzle by [Helsingin Sanomat](https://hs.fi/pelit/sanalouhos).
Sometimes it might be a bit too hairy to solve and in the past it didn't use to have a mechanism for getting help when you are stuck.
This solver figures out all the possible solutions for the puzzle and creates a web [page](https://kaakock.github.io/sanalouhos) which can be used to check whether a word you have come up with is a part of _a_ solution for todays puzzle.

Built with rust because why not, if you have any optimizations or improvements that would make it faster and/or better please feel free to open a PR. Those will be reviewed when I have time.
